                     MUSICAL DOUBLE PENDULUM
                 GABRIELLI Bastien & PEIGNE Aurore

Repository  dedicated to the RTES project work from PEIGNÃ‰ Aurore 
and GABRIELLI Bastien.

This program implements a musical double pendulum using real time 
tasks. You  can  find  all  the  parameters related to the double 
pendulum  in  the "functions.h". You can freely change the masses, 
the  angles  and  the  angular  velocities defined in the file in  
order to get antoher chaotic and random behavior and music.
Nonetheless,  since  the  graphic scaling as not been implemented
yet, you might not change too much the values of L1 and L2.

First you need to have allegro4 and csfml librairies installed :
sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev
sudo apt-get install liballegro4-dev

Then, you can use the dedicated makefile to compile the project
while being in the project general folder.

Enjoy ! :-)
